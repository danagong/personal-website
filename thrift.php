<strong >Reducing Campus Wide Waste: One Article at a Time</strong>
</div>
    In response to inconsistensies in our branding around the campus, the Thrift e-board and I were tasked
    to refine our branding with a new and simpler logo and a standardized color scheme.
    We played off of vintage themes with a warm toned color scheme and designed a new hand-drawn logo.

<strong>Fast Fashion Initatives</strong>
</div>
     Year round, Cornell Thrift hosts a variety of events and mending workshops as a way
     to allow students to access new clothes and to be able to donate their old clothes in a sustainable manner.
     These events are often held in collaboration with other environment or fashion oriented clubs on campus to promote
     community building on campus.
